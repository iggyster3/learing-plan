This is my readme plan for week 6.
I want to practice our previous weeks by making small game application with Richard using some external data from Ajax.
I will continue reading my ML book in Ruby and maybe implement some of the algorithms in the future subject to allowed time.
I will finish my book js and jquery and probably read something about nodejs.
In my freetime i will read a bit on paraller computing and c# to train my brain (proably most of the reading will be done on the train still 2h of reading subject to available seats :).
